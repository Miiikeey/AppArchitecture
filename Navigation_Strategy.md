Navigation Strategy for Music Streaming App
Status
The status of this ADR is accepted
Context
We have determined a few navigational tactics that will help us create a pleasant and user-friendly streaming service after brainstorming the features of our music streaming app.

Decision
By keeping this in mind, we can decide what kind of navigational tactics to employ. Among these concepts will be a hamburger menu and search capabilities. Additionally, the aforementioned menus and functionality will be designed in a way that makes sense to consumers. An worldwide sign for a menu, for instance, is three parallel lines placed vertically on top of one another.
Search Functionality:
1. It is simpler for consumers to locate precisely what they are looking for when they have the ability to search within the app. It will be simple to understand the function of the search bar thanks to its user-friendly design.

Hamburger Menu:
1. Users may easily traverse the application with the help of the hamburger menu. Users can access a variety of tabs using the hamburger menu, which are concealed by the menu symbol and only appear when necessary.
Consequences
Hamburger Menu:
1.	 The number of buttons that must be pressed in order for the user to reach their destination is a problem that might arise when utilizing a hamburger menu. When utilizing an application, users will become disinterested and impatient if there are too many processes involved.
2.	 This may also imply that crucial information is concealed from the consumer at first glance.
